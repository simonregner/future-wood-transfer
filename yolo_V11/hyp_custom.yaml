# hyp_custom.yaml
# base seg hyp — copy & paste all the defaults, then override:

# LR schedule
lr0: 0.0005        # initial LR (was 0.001)
lrf: 0.01          # final LR (cosine end LR multiplier)

# regularization
weight_decay: 0.0005  # was 0.0001

# segmentation loss weight
seg: 0.7           # reduce the seg head’s relative weight (was 1.0)

# augmentations
mosaic: 0.7        # increase mosaic prob (was 0.5)
mixup: 0.4         # increase mixup prob (was 0.3)
hsv_h: 0.015       # color jitter, etc.
hsv_s: 0.7
hsv_v: 0.4

# (the rest—flip, paste, scale, translate—keep your defaults)
